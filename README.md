# Description of this Assignment

This assignment evaluates our understanding and ability to use the fundamental operations of exporting CSV files. Additionally, we had to self-learn how to scrap csv data from a Wikipedia page, using both programming languages -- R and Python.

## Tasks:

1.  Create this README.md file.
2.  Write a R program that scrapes CSV data from a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), convert it to a data frame, and export it as a CSV file.
3.  Repeat the tasks in step 2, however, using Python.
